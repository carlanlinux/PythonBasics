'''
The iterable is the object that you will parsing through in a for loop. Generally,
this object does not change while the for loop is being executed.

The iterator variable is the variable which stores a portion of the iterable when
the for loop is being executed. Each time the loop iterates, the value of the
iterator variable will change to a different portion of the iterable.

OJO: Python is unable to iterate over integers and floats.
